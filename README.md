### Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Collection**  
  WiSenseHub collects real-time WiFi data from Raspberry Pi devices. The data is streamed continuously using the MQTT protocol, ensuring low latency and up-to-the-second updates.

- **MQTT-Based Communication**  
  WiSenseHub facilitates seamless communication between Raspberry Pi devices and the server using the MQTT protocol. Raspberry Pis act as publishers, sending WiFi data, while the server operates as a central subscriber, efficiently aggregating data from multiple sources.

- **Data Upload to MinIO Buckets and attained high-performance storage**  
  The real-time data received from the Raspberry Pi devices is automatically uploaded to MinIO buckets for secure and efficient storage. MinIO serves as a high-performance, scalable solution for managing large volumes of streaming data.
  Leveraging MinIO, an open-source alternative to AWS S3, the system provides efficient storage for large-scale streaming data. MinIO organizes and stores data locally, offering seamless scalability and high performance.

- **Dockerized Deployment**  
  The system is fully containerized using Docker, ensuring easy deployment, scalability, and portability. This architecture simplifies building-wide data collection and management while enabling rapid scaling to handle increasing data volumes.

- **Python Pre-Processing Pipeline**  
  A robust Python-based pre-processing pipeline cleans and processes WiFi data received from Raspberry Pi devices. This ensures the data is optimized for long-term storage and analysis.

- **ElasticSearch for Advanced Querying**  
  WiSenseHub integrates ElasticSearch for powerful querying and analysis. ElasticSearch indexes both WiFi and user device data, enabling efficient, real-time data exploration and advanced insights, replacing traditional DynamoDB and Lambda solutions.

- **Scalable Architecture**  
  The systemâ€™s modular design ensures easy scalability, allowing for the addition of new Raspberry Pi devices or topics without extensive reconfiguration.

- **Secure Data Transmission**  
  Implements industry-standard encryption protocols such as TLS/SSL for secure data transmission between Raspberry Pi devices and the central server.

- **Support for Custom Topics**  
  Enables flexibility by supporting custom MQTT topics for additional types of sensor data, making it adaptable to various IoT use cases.

- **Automated Alert System**  
  Configurable alerts can be set up for specific events or anomalies detected in the data stream, ensuring prompt notifications for critical insights.

- **Fault-Tolerant System**  
  Designed with robust error-handling mechanisms to ensure continuous operation and automatic recovery in case of hardware or network failures.
